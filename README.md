It is classification problem means output variable is categorical, the output variable is wheather survived or not. Here 12 feature in that 1 be the ouput column.
First analysed data, clean the data, check for normality or not (if not then transform it) then handle outliers, encoding and train test split and modelling.
I used logistic regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boost and in which GB is best algorithm having 0.78947 accuracy.
SKILLS USED- Python, Data Wrangling, Data Cleaning, Python libraries, ML classification algorithms.
